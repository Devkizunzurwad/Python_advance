The statement consists of an assignment target followed by the assignment operator and an expression. When the statement is executed, the expression is evaluated and the resulting value is stored in the target.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Why does a class need to manually call a superclass&#39;s __init__ method?\n\nThe main reason for always calling base class _init__ is that base class may typically create member variable and initialize them to defaults.

Function scope is the area between the opening { of a function and its closing }, which may contain more \"local\" scopes. \nA label is visible in the entirety of the function within which it is defined, e.g. int c is not visible outside its enclosing block.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
