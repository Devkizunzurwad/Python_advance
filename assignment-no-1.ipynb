In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n\nA class is a template for creating objects in a program, whereas the object is an instance of a class. \n class is a logical entity, while an object is a physical entity. A class does not allocate memory space; on the other hand, an object allocates memory space.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n\nhe calling process is automatic while the receiving process is not (its explicit). This is the reason the first parameter of a function in class must be the object itself. Writing this parameter as self is merely a convention.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n\nThe __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose.
